## Changes in supported environments

### Elasticsearch

With 3.12, Optimize now supports Elasticsearch `8.9`. Elasticsearch `8.8` is no longer supported.

If you need to update your Elasticsearch cluster, refer to the general [Elasticsearch update guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html). Usually, the only thing you need to do is perform a [rolling update](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rolling-upgrades.html).

### Localization file

The following terms have been added to or removed from the localization file `en.json` since the last release:

[en.json.diff](../translation-diffs/differences_localization_311_312.diff)

- Lines with a `+` in the beginning mark the addition/update of a term; lines with a `-` mark the removal of a term.
