In this guide we will show you how to use Identity to create a group. Groups are a way to apply a set of [roles](/self-managed/identity/user-guide/roles/add-assign-role.md) and authorizations to [users](/self-managed/identity/user-guide/roles/add-assign-role.md).

## Create a group

To create a group using Identity, take the following steps:

1. Log in to the Identity UI and navigate to the **Groups** tab:

![create-group-tab](../img/create-group-tab.png)

2. Click the **Add Group** button located on the top right of the table and a modal will open.

3. Fill in the name of the group. For this guide, we use an example value. After inserting the name, click **Add**:

On confirmation, the modal closes, the table updates, and your new group is shown:
