The [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) integration is a community extension that allows you to easily leverage Zeebe within your Quarkus environment.

Essentially, Quarkus provides a wrapper around the [Zeebe Java Client](/apis-tools/java-client/index.md), and is preconfigured with sensible defaults so you can get started with minimal configuration. Add a dependency, implement a worker, and add your credentials in your Quarkus project.

The integration also provides Quarkus developer services to start everything you need as Docker containers for local development. [Zeebe-dev-monitor](https://github.com/lorislab/zeebe-dev-monitor) UI is also included as a developer service.
