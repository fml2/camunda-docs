[Zeebe](/components/zeebe/zeebe-overview.md) clients use [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) to communicate with the Zeebe cluster.
See [Zeebe API RPCs](gateway-service.md) for all available operations.

To authorize the Zeebe API (gRPC) in a [Self-Managed](/self-managed/about-self-managed.md) setup,
see [client authorization](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/security/client-authorization.md).
