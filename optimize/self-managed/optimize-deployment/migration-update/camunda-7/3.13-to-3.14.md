:::note Heads up!
To update Optimize to version 3.14, perform the steps in the [migration and update instructions](./instructions.md).
:::

The update to 3.14 can be performed from any 3.13 release.

Here you will find information about:

- Limitations
- Known issues
- Changes in supported environments
- Changes in behavior (for example, due to a new feature)
- Changes in translation resources

## Versioning

As of Optimize 3.14, instances of Optimize running with Camunda 7 exclusively use the `3.x.x` versioning scheme. Instances of Optimize running with Camunda 8 exclusively use the `8.x.x` versioning scheme. This means you will only be able to update to Optimize 3.14 if you currently use Optimize 3.13 or below. Optimize instances of versions 8.5 and below cannot be upgraded to Optimize 3.14.

To ensure that Optimize 8 upgrades are not applied to Operate instances using Camunda 7, the 3.14 upgrade runs a check against the connected database before executing, and exits the upgrade if any Camunda 8 data is present in your setup. Specifically, it validates that there is no data present in the `position-based-import-index`, which is exclusively used for Camunda 8 data imports.

If you encounter issues upgrading to 3.14 in your Camunda 7 environment, please contact Support.

## Changes in behavior

### Telemetry

Optimize no longer gathers telemetry data, and this is removed from the UI and Elasticsearch. The associated key in the configuration file (`telemetry.telemetryEndpoint`) was removed.

## Changes in supported environments

### Camunda 7

Optimize now requires at least Camunda 7 `7.20.0` and supports up to `7.22.0+`. Camunda 7 `7.19.x` is no longer supported.

### Java

Optimize now supports Java 21+.

### Elasticsearch

Optimize now supports Elasticsearch 8.13.0+.

See the [supported environments]($docs$/reference/supported-environments/#component-requirements) documentation for the full range of supported versions.
