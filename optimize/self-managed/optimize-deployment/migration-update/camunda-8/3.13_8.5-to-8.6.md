:::note Heads up!
To update Optimize to version 8.6, perform the steps in the [migration and update instructions](./instructions.md).
:::

The update to 8.6 can be performed from any 8.5 release.

Here you will find information about:

- Limitations
- Known issues
- Changes in supported environments
- Changes in behavior (for example, due to a new feature)
- Changes in translation resources

## Changes in behavior

### Telemetry

Optimize no longer gathers telemetry data, and this is removed from the UI and Elasticsearch. The associated key in the configuration file (`telemetry.telemetryEndpoint`) was removed.

### Java

Optimize now supports Java 21+.

### Elasticsearch

Optimize now supports Elasticsearch 8.13.0+.

See the [supported environments]($docs$/reference/supported-environments/#component-requirements) documentation for the full range of supported versions.

### Artifact and Docker tag separation

Starting with Camunda 8.6, Optimize artifact has been split into two distinct versions, and versioning between Camunda 7 and Camunda 8 is no longer interchangeable:

- **Before Camunda 8.6**: Versions like `8.x` and `3.x` (used for Camunda 7) could sometimes be used interchangeably.
- **From Camunda 8.6 onwards**: `8.6 != 3.14`. Each version corresponds strictly to its platform:
  - **Camunda 7**: Uses the `3.x` versioning scheme and the `latest` Docker tag.
  - **Camunda 8**: Uses the `8.x` versioning scheme and the `8-latest` Docker tag.

#### Action required:

- **Camunda 7 Users**: Continue using `3.x` versions and the `latest` Docker tag.
- **Camunda 8 Users**: Update your configurations to use `8.x` versions and the `8-latest` Docker tag.

Make sure to update your Docker configurations accordingly to ensure compatibility.
